[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/manu/Documents/Projet/RECH/Tracking/TalosCV/ROS/catkin_ws/src/tiago_controller/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findinria_wbc.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "inria_wbc", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "inria_wbc" with
  any of the following names:

    inria_wbcConfig.cmake
    inria_wbc-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "inria_wbc" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "inria_wbc_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "inria_wbc" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
