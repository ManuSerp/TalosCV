# TalosCV

TalosCV is a program to do computer vision on the Talos and Tiago robots.
I am doing this project in my studies at the Ecole des mines de Nancy, with [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/) Team Larsen.

I aim to track objects and interact with the objects through the robots.

I am using the whole body controller of the [Larsen Team](https://gitlab.inria.fr/locolearn/public/docker_inria_wbc) and the [pysot](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot) framework for tracking using siamese neural network
